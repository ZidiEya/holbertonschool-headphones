         🌠 In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. 
         🌠 You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive  design knowledges that you learned previously.

        You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you 
        want.
        🚀the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks    
        the same as the designer file.
        tasks
        
       🎯 0. Read and be familiar with Figma 🖋️:
           🔵Important notes with Figma:
               if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
               some values are in float - feel free to round them
               
       🎯 1. Header:
          🔵Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:
          🔵reset CSS styling
          🔵use variables
          🔵simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
          🔵avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
          🔵simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
          🔵Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - 
          it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.
