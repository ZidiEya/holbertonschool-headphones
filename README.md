         In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. 
         You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive  design knowledges that you learned previously.

        You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you 
        want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks    
        the same as the designer file.
